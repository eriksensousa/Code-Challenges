# Understanding Linked List

To exemplify how a linked list works, let's exemplify with a representation of the linked list of letters as information
As soon as you start building the linked list, it is empty, that means there are no elements in the linked list. In this case, the first and last elements of the linked list are pointing to null. See the figure:

We can insert the letter A in this Linked List. Then, we can insert the letter B and finally, we can insert the letter C, according to the figure presented with the sequence
Note that the size of the linked list changes with each letter that is entered. We have size 1 when only the letter A is inserted. Size 2, when the letters A and B are inserted and, finally, size 3, when the letters A, B and C are inserted



If you want to remove an element from this linked list, you can remove any element, regardless of the element's position. It can be at the beginning, at the end and even there in the middle of the linked list
For example, let's remove the letter B from the linked list and see what the linked list looks like.



In the same way as the model, considering a linked list of integers that is initially empty, carry out and present the following operations by means of figures:
StartElement();
InsertStart(43);
InsertEnd(89);
InsertMiddle(55,2);
FinalElement();
ShowList();
Remove(55);
Remove(43);
Remove(7);
Remove(89);
